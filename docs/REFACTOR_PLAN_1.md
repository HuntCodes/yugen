## Impact of Refactoring
- Phase 2 (Component Refactoring):
  - Original screen component files: 1,491 lines (MainApp: 553, TrainingPlan: 524, OnboardingChat: 414)
  - Refactored screen components: 787 lines across multiple smaller files (47% reduction)

- Phase 3 (Hook Refactoring):
  - Original hook files: 1,410 lines (useChatFlow: 1092, useOnboardingFlow: 318)
  - Refactored useChatFlow: reduced from 1092 to 67 lines in main file (94% reduction)
  - useOnboardingFlow: already within target at 318 lines
  - Total Phase 3 reduction: 707 lines (50% reduction)

- Phase 4-6 (Services, Library, and Types Reorganization):
  - Created organized services layer with dedicated modules for different concerns
  - Restructured library code into logical subdirectories with clear responsibilities
  - Extracted types into dedicated files for better reusability and maintainability
  - Added proper type interfaces for all data structures
  - Reduced direct dependencies between components and data access logic
  - Improved the ability to unit test by separating concerns
  - Enhanced code discoverability with consistent naming and organization

- Phase 7 (Documentation):
  - Added README files to all major directories explaining purpose and content
  - Improved code discoverability and onboarding for new developers
  - Documented component responsibilities and directory organization
  - Created a self-documenting codebase structure

- Phase 8 (Index Files):
  - Simplified imports with barrel files for cleaner code
  - Enabled importing multiple components from a single path
  - Reduced import statement verbosity
  - Created consistent patterns for code organization and access
  - Improved maintainability with centralized exports

- Overall refactoring impact:
  - Original codebase (targeted sections): 2,901 lines of code
  - Refactored codebase: 1,172 lines in main files (plus extracted components)
  - While the total line count across all files has not drastically reduced, the codebase now has:
    - Better separation of concerns
    - More focused, single-responsibility components
    - Improved maintainability
    - Enhanced testability
    - More reusable components
    - Clearer code organization
    - Stronger type safety
    - Better documentation and discoverability

## Decision Log
This section tracks key decisions made during the refactoring process:

1. Breaking down oversized files into component folders rather than subcomponents
2. Creating dedicated services layer to handle business logic
3. Introducing consistent component and hook organization by feature area
4. Using TypeScript interfaces for component props to improve type safety
5. Organizing lib folder into api, utils, and constants for better code organization
6. Creating centralized type definitions in dedicated directory
7. Using index files for cleaner exports and imports
8. Extracting utility functions from large files into focused modules
9. Adding README.md files to each directory to document purpose and responsibilities
10. Creating index.ts barrel files for cleaner imports and exports throughout the codebase

## Notes
- When extracting components, ensure props are properly typed
- Use React.memo() for performance-critical components
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Update imports as files are moved 
- Add README.md files to each directory explaining component/file purposes and responsibilities
