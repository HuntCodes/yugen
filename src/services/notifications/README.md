# Notification Services

This directory contains services for managing push notifications in the Yugen app.

## Overview

The notification system provides daily motivational messages from the user's selected coach. These notifications are sent every morning at 8 AM and include:

- Personalized greeting from the user's coach
- Today's workout details (type, distance, time)
- Weather-based motivation message
- Coach-specific motivational closing

## Files

- `notificationService.ts`: Core notification functions
- `index.ts`: Exports for clean imports
- `__tests__/notificationMessages.test.ts`: Test scenarios for message generation
- `testRunner.ts`: Standalone test runner
- `README.md`: This documentation

## Features

### Daily Morning Notifications
- Scheduled at 8:00 AM local time
- Personalized content based on:
  - User's selected coach
  - Today's training plan
  - Local weather conditions
  - Coach communication style

### Permission Management
- Requests notification permissions on first use
- Handles permission denial gracefully
- Provides settings to enable/disable notifications

### Coach Personalities
- **Craig**: "Rise and shine!" - Direct, high-energy motivation
- **Thomas**: "Good morning, athlete" - Technical, focused on form
- **Dathan**: "Morning, runner" - Strategic, data-driven approach

### Weather Integration
- Uses location services to get local weather
- Adapts message based on conditions:
  - Hot weather: Reminds to stay hydrated
  - Cold weather: "Perfect running weather"
  - Rain: "Embrace the elements"
  - Pleasant: "Ideal conditions"

## Testing

### Automated Testing
Run the notification message tests to verify different scenarios:

```bash
# Run all notification tests
npm run test:notifications

# Or run directly with tsx
npx tsx src/services/notifications/testRunner.ts
```

### Test Scenarios
The test suite covers:

1. **Different Workouts**:
   - Easy runs
   - Tempo runs
   - Interval training
   - Long runs
   - Rest days
   - No workout scheduled

2. **Different Coaches**:
   - Craig (motivational, high energy)
   - Thomas (technical, precise)
   - Dathan (strategic, smart)

3. **Different Weather**:
   - Hot weather (>25째C)
   - Cold weather (<5째C)
   - Rainy conditions
   - Perfect conditions
   - No location/weather data

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Missing workout data
   - Weather service failures
   - Invalid coach IDs
   - Location permission denied

### Sample Messages

**Craig + Easy Run + Perfect Weather:**
> "Rise and shine! Today you've got an easy 6km run (about 36 minutes). It's 18째C with partly cloudy - ideal conditions for your run, so let's get going. Let's get after it! Hit me up if you need any adjustments or advice."

**Thomas + Intervals + Hot Weather:**
> "Good morning, athlete! Today you've got 7km of intervals (35 minutes) - let's get fast. It's warm at 29째C with clear sky, so stay hydrated out there, so let's get going. Remember, every step counts. Let me know if you want to make any changes or need guidance."

**Dathan + Rest Day + Rainy:**
> "Morning, runner! Today is a rest day - recovery is just as important as the hard work. There's some rain with moderate rain - embrace the elements, so let's get going. Smart training beats hard training. Message me if you need any tweaks or have questions."
